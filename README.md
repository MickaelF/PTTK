# PTTK
PTTK (Potato Thunder Tool Kit) is a small collection of tools to ease development on my personal c++ projects. It's not meant to be perfect, nor usable in a professional context. It's just here to help me develop things. And if it also helps you... that's a bonus. 

## What is this thing?
For now, it's only simple stuff. There is **a log system** that display what is written in the console and in a file on the computer. 
There is also a small command-line software to **parse these log**, if you need to read them more easily, and a small command-line **log generator**, to test the log parser. Both are in the '*extra*' folder. There is also a full-blown Qt viewer for these logs.

There is also a small collection of tools for **string manipulation**. 

## How do I use it? 
You should only need CMake version 3.17 and higher to be able to compile everything. If you want to see or use the log viewer, you will need Qt version 5.15 at least. I plan to add anexecutable directly in the release, but that's not my main goal right now.


## That's all? 
Yes. It's meant to be expended, and it will, as I continue to develop my others C++ projects. For now, I'm continuing my other projects, and the main one is a game using Unity, so it won't change for a bit.
