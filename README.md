# PTTK
PTTK (Potato Thunder Tool Kit) is a small collection of tools to ease development on my personal c++ projects.

## What is this thing ?
For now, it's only simple stuff. There is **a log system** that display what is written in the console and in a file on the computer. 
There is also a small command-line software to **parse these log**, if you need to read them more easily, and a small command-line **log gerenator**, to test the log parser. Both 
are in the '*extra*' folder.
There is also a small collection of tools for **string manipulation**. 

## That's all ? 
Yes... for now. I think I finally found a way to show my **Qt** skill. I'm planning on doing a GUI version of the log parser, on this repo. I may starts in the following weeks.
